# SudokuSolver
Background:\n
I wrote this Sudoklu solver in year 11 (2019). It was a personal project that I undertook as a sort of 'extenstion' to my Software Design and Development course.
The general idea behind the Sudoku solver was origninally to solve sudokus in any way possible. After some searching I was surprised to find that most sudoku solving programs used an optimised brute force (trial and error) method to solve sudokus. I decided that I wanted to create a set of logical algorithms to solve sudoku's. The solver would only enter a number if it was certain that the number was correct.
